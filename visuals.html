		<h2>Never Wet by Rustoleum</h2>

		<h3>I saw this video posted on Facebook and thought it was the most amazing thing ever! A waterproofing system is one thing missing from my life, especially if you&rsquo;re a messy eater, clumsy, etc. </p>
		<p>I can see this product being used in designs for product packaging, clothing designs, posters that need to be weatherproofed, etc.  It reminds me of the L.L. Bean button-up shirts my dad used to wear that were wrinkle free and water resistant. </p>
		<p>I could use this solution to weatherproof my posters for more hanging options; which, in turn will hopefully reach more people.</p>
